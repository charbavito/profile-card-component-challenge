## The Challenge
This was a very easy Challenge to do, after all, the proposal was to build a simple card, with only CSS and HTML. Even though it was pretty easy to do, it was really good for reinforcing the fundamentals of layout build, mainly in background image position concerns.

## My Process

As usual I started by configuring the project folder and initializing the version control sistem and gitignore file. Then I structured all the content sematically in HTML and finishes configuring the styles through SASS pre-processor.

### What I learned
This was a very easy Challenge to do and despite not having learned anything very new, it was excellent to practice and strengthen the bases of layout, background position controls and web development with CSS and HTML only.
